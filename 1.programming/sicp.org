- <<idiom>> <<idioms>> ::

  - plural: small, standard correct structures used in composing
    greater progams.  See the [[foreword-idiom-definition-quote]]

- <<algorithm>> ::

  - A program that perform a precise mathematical function, where is
    desired that they behave optimally, specially regarding execution
    time and storage.  See the [[foreword-algorithm-definition-quote]]

- <<procedural epistemology>> ::

  - Study of the structure of knowledge in an imperative point of
    view.  It answers ‘how to’ instead of ‘what is’.  See

* Notes

** [[info:sicp#Foreword][Foreword]]

- Sets three foci of consideration:

  - The mind: every program is a model that starts in the mind

  - Collection of computer programs: a knowledge of correct idioms and
    proven techniques for combination of them helps in structuring
    programs.

  - The computer: the computer obeys the laws of physics, another.

- Idioms definition quote:

  <<foreword-idiom-definition-quote>>
  #+begin_quote
  (...) complete formal arguments of correctness seldom accompany large
  programs.  Since large programs grow from small ones, it is crucial
  that we develop an arsenal of standard program structures of whose
  correctness we have become sure--we call them idioms--and learn to
  combine them into larger structures using organizational techniques of
  proven value.
  #+end_quote

- Algorithm definition quote:

  <<foreword-algorithm-definition-quote>>
  #+begin_quote
  Among the programs we write, some (but never enough) perform a
  precise mathematical function such as sorting or finding the maximum
  of a sequence of numbers, determining primality, or finding the
  square root.  We call such programs algorithms, and a great deal is
  known of their optimal behavior, particularly with respect to the
  two important parameters of execution time and data storage
  requirements.
  #+end_quote

- Advice

  #+begin_quote
  A programmer should acquire good algorithms and idioms.
  #+end_quote


** [[info:sicp#Preface 1e][Preface 1e]]

- Computer programs as a formal medium for expressing methodological
  ideas

  #+begin_quote
  (...) a computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to
  perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal medium for
  expressing ideas about methodology.
  #+end_quote

- Procedural epitemology quote

  <<preface-1e-procedural-epistemology-quote>>
  #+begin_quote
  (...) "procedural epistemology" -- the study of the structure of
  knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more
  declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects.
  Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions
  of "what is."  Computation provides a framework for dealing
  precisely with notions of "how to."

** [[info:sicp#Chapter 1][Building Abstractions With Procedures]]

- <<Process, data, and program>>
  - process :: beings that inhabits a computer
  - data :: abstract things manipulated by processes
  - program :: pattern of rules that directs a process

- Good engineering: Given a program, anticipate and visualize the
  behaviour of a process, to avoid errors.

- Modular design: new parts can be made or replaced indepently.
